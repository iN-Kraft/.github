# What is iNKraft?

iNKraft is a collection of high-quality Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) libraries and plugins.
It is designed to solve the hardest parts of KMP development: complex, low-level and platform-native interoperability.

We provide clean, "common" KMP APIs for complex tasks, built with a unique focus on supporting **all** KMP targets.
