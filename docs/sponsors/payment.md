# Payment & Billing

Since we host the repositories on GitHub including the packages, GitHub Sponsors is a natural fit for handling all financial transactions, as well as for access management to the repositories.

Therefore, to become a sponsor of iNKraft, a GitHub account is mandatory.

!!! example "Polar"

    This section is focused on GitHub and GitHub Sponsorship.
    Most of the points mentioned here also apply to Polar, including access rules, benefits and general procedures.
    When sponsoring using Polar, make sure your GitHub account is connected.

## Payment

GitHub Sponsors currently only accepts payments via credit card, as they removed support for PayPal at the beginning of 2023.
When entering your credit card details, ensure that the card remains valid over an extended period to prevent any disruptions to your sponsorship.

## Invoices

GitHub Sponsors automatically issues and send a payment receipt via email after each billing cycle.
These receipts serve as confirmation of payment rather than formal invioces.
As all transactions are managed by GitHub Sponsors, GitHub is your primary point of contact for payment and billing matters, not us.

## Refunds

We do not have insights or access to details related to sponsorship transactions of our sponsors, as GitHub does not provide us with this information.
For questions regarding payment issues or for more detailed information about your sponsorship, please get in touch with the GitHub support team.

## Discounts

Unfortunately, we can't offer discounts.
To ensure that everyone in the community can afford to become a sponsor, we keep the barrier low and set prices as low as possible, starting at $9 a month for personal accounts and at $14 a month for organizations.

## Billing cycle

The billing cycle is an account-level setting on GitHub and is set to monthly or yearly.
It can be changed at any time, so you might want to check the setting before sponsoring and change it either to monthly or yearly according to your own or your organization's preferences.

If, for whatever reason, you cannot change your billing cycle, a practical solution is to create a dedicated GitHub Bot Account where you set the billing cycle accordingly and use it specifically for your sponsorship contributions.
This is a strategy many organizational sponsors have successfully implemented.
