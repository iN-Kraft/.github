If you're curious about the duration of your sponsorship and the cancellation process, you will find everything you need to know below.

!!! example "Polar"

    This section is focused on GitHub and GitHub Sponsorship.
    Most of the points mentioned here also apply to Polar, including access rules, benefits and general procedures.
    When sponsoring using Polar, make sure your GitHub account is connected.

## Runtime

Sponsorships remain valid as long as monthly or yearly subscriptions are active and only expire when you cancel the sponsorship or when your payment method expires.

## Cancellation

Canceling your sponsorship initiates a cancellation request through GitHub, which is scheduled to take effect at the end of your current billing cycle.
This means you'll retain access to iNKraft private repsoitories until the cancellation officially becomes effective.

All transactions are processed by GitHub and as we don't receive any information regarding your payment, we can't provide details about when your cancellation will be in place.

### How to cancel

To cancel your sponsorship, please follow the step-by-step guide from GitHub.
If you sponsored using an organizational account, ensure that you cancel the sponsorship under that specific account, as the [collaborator and sponsor accounts may differ](access.md).

### Effects of cancellation

Upon the effective date of your cacnellation, GitHub will automatically remove you as a collaborator from private iNKraft repositories.
You will no longer receive updates.

!!! danger "GitHub deletes private forks"

    Please note that once you lose your collaborator status, GitHub will automatically delete your private fork of the iNKraft repositories.
    The extended usage of the latest version available to you at the time of cancellation is prohibited!

### Automatic cancellattion

If your credit cards expires, GitHub will automatically cancel your sponsorship and remove you as collaborator.
Regularly checking your payment method is recommended to avoid unintended cancellations.
If it happens, you can reinstate your sponsorship with a new credit card.
