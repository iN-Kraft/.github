# Access management

iNKraft provides private repositories hosted on GitHub and access is, therefore, managed through GitHub.
This section covers everything you need to know in order to gain access to the private repositories.

!!! example "Polar"

    This section is focused on GitHub and GitHub Sponsorship.
    Most of the points mentioned here also apply to Polar, including access rules, benefits and general procedures.
    When sponsoring using Polar, make sure your GitHub account is connected.

## How to get access

As the private repositories are hosted on GitHub, you require a GitHub account to become a sponsor and gain access.
After sponsoring iNKraft on one of our sponsoring tiers starting at $9 a month, you'll get access to the private repositories.

### Individuals

If you sponsor using a personal account, you will receive an invitation link via email to the private repositories immediately after initiating your sponsorship.
This link is valid for seven days.
Once you accept the invitation, you'll be ready to get started.

### Organizations

When sponsoring using an organization account, GitHub will not send an automated invitation via email to access the private repositories.
Due to GitHub limitations, granting access to a private repository for an entire organization is not possible.

Therefore, please contact us at [sponsors@datlag.dev](mailto:sponsors@datlag.dev) with the name of a personal account or the name of a bot account that is publicly or privately listed as an owner of your GitHub organization after you received a confirmation that your sponsorship was initiated.

We will add this designated account as a collaborator, and once the invitation is accepted within seven days, your organization will be all set to get started.

### Enterprises

If you would like to sponsor us using an enterprise account, we recommend using a personal account or a bot account to initiate the sponsorship and access the private repositories using this account.
